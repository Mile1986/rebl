[Here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25956937/how-to-build-minified-and-uncompressed-bundle-with-webpack) is the question i found at `stackoverflow`, it seems many people are suffering for this.\n\nAs a workaround, you may do something like `webpack && webpack --config webpack.config.prod.js`, but the solution is really ugly and inelegant.\n\nThat's why i am here! ^^\n\n## Installation ##\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev unminified-webpack-plugin\n```\n\n## Usage ##\n\n```javascript\nvar path = require('path');\nvar webpack = require('webpack');\nvar UnminifiedWebpackPlugin = require('unminified-webpack-plugin');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n    entry: {\n        index: './src/index.js'\n    },\n    output: {\n        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),\n        filename: 'library.min.js'\n    },\n    plugins: [\n        new webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin({\n            compress: {\n                warnings: false\n            }\n        }),\n        new UnminifiedWebpackPlugin()\n    ]\n};\n```\n\nBy doing as above, you will get two files `library.min.js` and `library.js`. No need execute `webpack` twice, it just works!^^\n\n>`filename` includes `min`, such as: `ad-min.js`, `ad-min-1.0.js`, will be treated as minified name as well. See [cope with 'min' in names like 'Admin'](https://github.com/leftstick/unminified-webpack-plugin/pull/8)\n\n**Note:** Does not work with `BannerPlugin`, see [this comment](https://github.com/leftstick/unminified-webpack-plugin/issues/1#issuecomment-226413904) for an explanation.\n\n## Configuration ##\n\n`postfix`: you can specify the `nomin` part as you wish. `nomin` is the default postfix once you haven't specify `min` in `output.filename`. And it can be customized by specifying this option, following is example:\n\n```javascript\nvar path = require('path');\nvar webpack = require('webpack');\nvar UnminifiedWebpackPlugin = require('unminified-webpack-plugin');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n    entry: {\n        index: './src/index.js'\n    },\n    output: {\n        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),\n        filename: 'library.js'//no \"min\" specified\n    },\n    plugins: [\n        new webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin({\n            compress: {\n                warnings: false\n            }\n        }),\n        new UnminifiedWebpackPlugin({\n            postfix: 'unmin'//specify \"nomin\" postfix\n        })\n    ]\n};\n```\n\n>By doing as above, you will get two files `library.js` and `library.unmin.js`\n\n\n## LICENSE ##\n\n[MIT License](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leftstick/unminified-webpack-plugin/master/LICENSE)\n\n\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/unminified-webpack-plugin\n[npm-image]: https://badge.fury.io/js/unminified-webpack-plugin.png\n[travis-url]:https://api.travis-ci.org/leftstick/unminified-webpack-plugin.svg?branch=master\n[david-url]: https://david-dm.org/leftstick/unminified-webpack-plugin.png\n[dt-url]:https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/unminified-webpack-plugin.svg\n[license-url]:https://img.shields.io/npm/l/unminified-webpack-plugin.svg\n",
